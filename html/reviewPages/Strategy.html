        <!--Paragraph 1-->
        <p class="">

          <h2>Citywars TD</h2>
          <p>
            City Wars Tower Defense is a game that combines strategy and action, immersing players in a lively city
            filled with relentless enemies.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the game's best features is its tower defense mechanics. As someone who enjoys strategy games, I had
            a great time coming up with different defensive strategies to deal with waves of enemy forces. The game
            gives you a variety of towers to choose from, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. This allows you to
            experiment and customize your strategies. The real-time combat adds excitement, as you control your troops
            in intense battles. The mix of planning and quick decision-making makes the gameplay engaging and
            challenging for fans of the genre.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, City Wars Tower Defense has impressive graphics and a well-designed city setting. The detailed
            cityscapes and animations make the battles visually appealing. The game's sound effects and soundtrack
            further enhance the immersive experience, creating a thrilling atmosphere.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there are some areas where City Wars Tower Defense could be better. One thing that stood out to me
            was the lack of variety in enemy types and scenarios. While the initial battles are exciting and
            challenging, it would have been more enjoyable if there were more diverse enemies and situations to face.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the game offers a decent experience, it didn't quite reach its full potential in my opinion, earning a
            6/10 rating.<br><br>

            If you're interested in trying out the game yourself, you can find it
            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1890650/Citywars_Tower_Defense/" target="_blank">here</a> on
            Steam.

      <!--Bad North-->
      <div id="BadNorth" class="bg-white p-3 rounded-4">
        <h2 class="textOutline">Bad North</h2>
        <p class="textOutline">
          Bad North, a charming strategy game, kept me hooked with its unique mix of tactics and delightful visuals.
          With its engaging gameplay and polished design, it easily earns an 8/10 rating from me.<br><br>

          One of the best things about Bad North is how easy it is to play and understand. As someone who enjoys
          strategy games, I loved commanding my troops and defending my island kingdom from Viking invaders. The game
          cleverly combines real-time strategy and tower defense, making it exciting and fun. I had to think
          strategically and position my units in smart ways to fight off the enemies. The controls were simple, and the
          game's look and feel were clear and easy to follow. It was all about making smart decisions and having
          thrilling battles. Additionally, Bad North's art style and sounds make it a visually stunning and immersive
          experience. The
          graphics are simple but beautiful, with vibrant colors and lots of detail. The sound effects and music create
          a wonderful atmosphere, making the game come to life. The combination of visuals and sounds made each battle
          feel like a work of art.<br><br>

          One area where Bad North could improve is in the variety of gameplay. After playing for a while, the islands
          and enemies start to feel the same, which can get a bit repetitive. It would be more exciting if there were
          different types of islands, enemies, and goals to keep things fresh. Additionally, the game's progression
          system feels a bit limited. As you play and defend islands, you unlock
          and upgrade units, but there aren't many options for customizing and adding depth to your strategies. It would
          be great to have more types of units, upgrades, or special abilities to make each playthrough feel more
          unique.<br><br>

          In conclusion, Bad North is an addictive strategy game that stands out with its enjoyable gameplay and
          charming visuals. With its easy-to-understand mechanics and beautiful presentation, it offers a satisfying and
          immersive experience. While it doesn't reinvent the genre, its polished execution and engaging gameplay make
          it a must-play for strategy game fans. With an 8/10 rating, I highly recommend Bad North to anyone looking for
          a fun and visually appealing strategic adventure.<br><br>
